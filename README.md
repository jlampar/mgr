Master thesis in progress, web-page about Gastner-Newman density-equalizing maps (http://www.pnas.org/content/101/20/7499.full.pdf). Anamorphic cartogram computed in ArcMAP and transferred to SVG via D3.js. Page shows how different cartogram parameters force anamorphosis to transform country borders in a different manner.

Due to large amount of data to transfer, maps are loaded with some delay.
